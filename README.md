# Machine Learning Miderm Assessments

Attached are the three Python assignments I completed for my third year module, 'Mathematics and Applications of Machine Learning'.

The first test includes various problems covering some of the basics of the numpy package and pandas series in Python. (97%)

The second (75%) and third (79%) tests includes more involved machine learning problems, such as finding the empirical error, training a Pipeline, creating an interative method with respect to LASSO and more.
